a. What is the use of SQlite open helper class in SQLite?

SQLiteOpenHelper - A helper class to manage database creation and version management.

We create a subclass implementing onCreate(SQLiteDatabase), onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase, int, int) and optionally onOpen(SQLiteDatabase).

And this class takes care of opening the database if it exists, creating it if it does not, and upgrading it as necessary. 

Transactions are used to make sure the database is always in a sensible state.

============================================

b. What is the use of OnUpgrade function in SQLiteOpenHelper class?

onUpgrade() â€“ This method is called when database is upgraded like modifying
the table structure, adding constraints to database etc.

============================================

c. How to show sqlite database table information in android application what is the best way to do it?

create a method to read entry inside our Database class (which is extending SQLiteOpenHelper) 
Example: readAnEntry(int id)

now in our MainActivity class create intent inside onClick method
Example: 
	public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> parent, View view, int position, long id) {
        Intent intent = new Intent(this, SecondActivity.class);
        intent.putExtra(new Pojo().getName(), listOfEntries.get(position).getId());
        startActivityForResult(intent, 1);

in our SecondActivity class 
we can get intent 
create an object to Database class
and retrieve an entry using out Database class's method to read entry (say: readAnEntry(int id))
Example:
        Intent intent = getIntent();
        int id = intent.getIntExtra(new PojoClass().getName(), -1);

        db = new DB(getApplicationContext());
        selectedEntry = db.readAnEntry(id);

        nameTextView.setText(selectedEntry.getName());


Where PojoClass consists of Column variables and Setters ad Getters
Example:
public class Pojo {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private String rollNumber;

   constructors...

   Setters and getters...

}
